## EchoLearn 

Like Einstein, I also believe that you don't really understand something unless you can explain it very simply and concisely. Throughout my undergraduate degree, I've always benefited from teaching friends and being a TA. Doing this made me realize which topics I really understand and which need improvement, often leading to new insights via discussion. Echolearn is an attempt to make this more systematic, allowing users to record themselves teaching a concept when no one's around to practice on. The user can then upload a file to compare their understanding to, or ask the LLM to compare with it its own understanding, based on one of 4 default modes or a custom mode. The application will then generate a report, assessing the 'mini-lecture' on accuracy, clarity of thought, delivery, and coherence.
